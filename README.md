## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed by Derek Chan and Olivia Gallucci under the supervision of Dr. Leon Reznik. The IDS is designed to detect network attacks using decision trees and neural networks. 

## Usage Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ids-aiml
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd ids-aiml
```

### Step 3: Explore the Project Structure

Take a moment to explore the project structure as well as the [Weka user guide](https://oliviagallucci.com/ids-security-using-decision-trees-and-neural-networks/#weka-user-guide). Read the steps in the "Data preparation" and "Operation" sections to know how we preprocessed the data using the provided Python script (`preprocessing.py`).

### Step 4: Set Up Environment

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, concurrent.futures). Weka is also required for the neural network module.

### Step 5: Misuse IDS

#### Design

- Use the provided Python script for misuse IDS (`misuse_ids.py`).
- Adjust parameters based on your requirements.

#### Operation

- Run the script to train and test the misuse IDS.
- Review the generated results and metrics.

### Step 6: Anomaly IDS

#### Design

- Utilize the provided [Python script](cic-ids-2017/preprocessing.py) for anomaly IDS (`anomaly_ids.py`).
- Adjust parameters as needed.

#### Operation

- Execute the script to train and test the anomaly IDS.
- Examine the results and metrics.

### Step 7: Neural Network

#### Design

- Refer to the [Weka user guide](https://oliviagallucci.com/ids-security-using-decision-trees-and-neural-networks/#weka-user-guide) for loading and preprocessing data for neural network training.
- Set hyperparameters for the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as described in the README.

#### Operation

- Use Weka Explorer to train and test the MLP neural network.
- Evaluate the model's performance based on accuracy and other metrics.

### Step 8: Data Analysis with Weka

- Follow the [Weka user guide's instructions](https://oliviagallucci.com/ids-security-using-decision-trees-and-neural-networks/#weka-user-guide) for loading data, preprocessing, building a machine learning model, and evaluating the model.

### Step 9: Tests and Results

- Explore the provided [test results](https://oliviagallucci.com/ids-security-using-decision-trees-and-neural-networks/#ids-results) for the IDS systems, including accuracy, training time, and memory footprint.
